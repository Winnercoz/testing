<h2>How do we compare?</h2><img src="images/icon-tick.png" alt=""> </div> <div class="promoboxtext"><p><strong style="font-size: 18px;">1. Finders Fee Tutors</strong></p> <p>For tutors on our finders fee pricing (over 95%), we take a simple, one off payment for the tutor's contact details. We do not take any ongoing commission from the tutors on this pricing model. 
</p>
<ul class="promolist" style="width: 100%;">  <li>No sign up fees - you can <a href="signup.html">register</a> for no charge, and browse and communicate with our entire database of thousands of tutors.</li>  <li>Pay online securely using PayPal, even if you do not have a PayPal account.</li>  <li>Some of our tutors also provide a discounted 1st lesson when you purchase their details.</li>  <li>Since 2005 Tutor Hunt has helped thousands of students find the right tutor.</li> </ul><p style="clear: both;">&nbsp;</p><p> Most tuition agencies will select your tutor for you, based on who they think would be suitable. Tutor Hunt doesn't work this way: we believe the parent, or the student themselves to be the best judge. They will know better than an agency assessor who is the right tutor for them.<br> Most agencies work by charging high commission rates, taking a substantial cut of the tutor's earnings. This has the effect of driving up the tutor's hourly rate considerably, as the tutor will seek to recoup their lost funds. The hourly rates of finder's fee tutors should be less than those with added commission, as they are in complete control of their rates.<p class="lowlight">The table below illustrates a comparison of costs between Tutor Hunt Finders Fee Tutors and a typical agency </p><table style="width:100%;" class="promotable">  <tr>    <th>&nbsp;	<th>Tutor Hunt <small>(average price)</small>	<th>Agency <small>(average price)</small>  <tr>    <th>Finder's fee     <td>&pound;24	<td>&pound;0 - &pound;60  <tr>    <th>12 x 1 hour lessons     <td>&pound;252 <sup>*</sup>	<td>&pound;480 - &pound;720 <sup>&#8224;</sup>  <tr>    <th>Total <small>(12 lessons)</small>    <td><strong>&pound;276</strong>	<td><strong>&pound;480 - &pound;780</strong> </table><p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 17px;"><strong>Your Savings: &pound;204 - &pound;504 per term</strong> (<em>1 lesson per week for 12 weeks</em>)<p style="font-size: 11px; line-height: 1.4; color: #444; font-style:italic;">* &nbsp;Please note that these prices are based on our tutors average rates (April 2015)<br> &#8224; &nbsp;Range of costs from agencies that we contacted in our sample.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 18px;">2. Booking Tutors</strong></p>
Tutors who signed up after 1st April 2019 become part of our booking system, which means we collect between 15%-25% of the tutors rate <em>(or &pound;4.00 for tutors who rate falls below &pound;16.00 per hour)</em>.  We believe this rate is substantially lower than most other agencies.  The benefits for tutors on our commission structure is as follows;</p>
<ul class="promolist" style="width: 100%;"><li>You do not need to purchase their contact details, meaning there is no upfront fee.
<li>We manage the whole booking process, and collect payments for the tutor, so you do not need to worry about transferring money or  bringing cash to your lessons.
<li>Scheduling lessons is easy to manage  through Tutor Hunt, if you need to reschedule or cancel lessons it can easily be updated through our system, your tutor is automatically notified.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions for students</h2><div class="title-header">		<h3>What is Tutor Hunt</h3>	</div><div class="title-content">		<p>Tutor Hunt has one simple objective: To bring tutors and students together. Whatever subject you are striving to learn, be it for an academic assessment, or for your own self advancement, we believe we have the perfect tutor for you. If you are a tutor seeking to find students, we will help you locate those who can benefit from your knowledge and teaching expertise.</p>	</div><div class="title-header">		<h3>How much will the tuition cost me, and who do I pay?</h3>	</div>	<div class="title-content">		<p>Through our site you can message as many tutors as you wish, for no charge. Once you are happy to start tuition with your selected tutor, we have two types of payment systems:<p>1. For <strong>finders' fee tutors</strong> we will ask for a single payment. Many sites have large sign up fees, which must be renewed annually; For over 95% of our tutors we simply charge a one off finder's fee of &pound;19.99 + VAT. This is the only fee we take for helping you find a tutor which helps us maintain our website and attract new tutors across the UK.</p><p>2. For tutors which are part of our <strong>booking system</strong>, we collect between 15%-25% of the tutor's rate. We believe this rate is substantially lower than most other agencies. For these tutors, we do not charge any finder's fee.</p><p>A large proportion of our tutors are currently on the finders' fee model, any tutor who signed up after 1st April 2019 is on our commission model.</p></div><div class="title-header">		<h3>How to make a payment?</h3>	</div>	<div class="title-content"><p>In order to make a payment, please open the conversation you are having with the chosen tutor.</p><p>For <strong>Finder`s fee tutors</strong>, at the top of the conversation thread you will see a green button that says '<em>buy tutors contact details</em>'. Please click on this button and you will be directed to our payment page. The cost for a tutor's details is &pound;19.99 + VAT.</p><p>For <strong>booking system tutors</strong>, lessons are confirmed by entering in your payment details once the tutor has setup a schedule, we only take payment 24 hours after the lesson has taken place.	</div><div class="title-header"><h3>How much does the tutor charge?</h3>			</div>			<div class="title-content"><p>You can see the hourly rate displayed on each tutor's profile page.

Perhaps you have decided that you only want to have lessons at home: you can simply tell this to any tutors you message through our site. Most tutors will be willing to travel, and our search facility will show a listing of tutors located in close proximity to you. Many students prefer to have the tuition take place in a public location, such as a library or coffee shop. Many tutors also specialize in online tuition, negating the need for travel. </p>			</div><div class="title-header"><h3>How do I contact a tutor through Tutor Hunt?</h3>			</div>			<div class="title-content"><p>You can start immediately, even if you are not registered with us. All you have to do is click the 'Search' button at the top of the page.

It might be that the tutor you contacted already has a full schedule. Please do not be discouraged - I'm sure the perfect tutor for you is out there. We would advise that you message 6-7 tutors so you are more likely to receive a response. Also, try and keep an eye on a tutor's response rate. This will give you an idea of how quickly they will respond to your message.</p>						</div><div class="title-header"><h3>How do I leave feedback?</h3>			</div>			<div class="title-content"><p>After a few weeks of tuition with your selected tutor, you are given an option to leave feedback on your tutor's profile.
